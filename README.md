# Online Blog Platform (Console Application)

This is a simple, console-based blogging application built with Java. It demonstrates a professional **layered architecture** and uses **Hibernate** for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) to a **MySQL** database.

## üìú Description

The application allows users to register, log in, create blog posts, comment on posts, and delete their own posts, all from a command-line interface. The primary goal of this project is to showcase a clean separation of concerns using a layered (n-tier) architecture.

## ‚ú® Features

* **User Management:**
    * Register a new user account.
    * Log in with an existing account.
* **Post Management:**
    * Create new blog posts.
    * View a list of all posts from all authors.
    * Delete your own posts.
* **Comment Management:**
    * Add comments to any post.
    * View all comments for a specific post.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

The project follows a strict layered architecture to separate responsibilities:

1.  **Presentation (UI) Layer (`com.blog.App`)**
    * Handles all console input and output.
    * Talks only to the Service layer.
2.  **Service Layer (`com.blog.service`)**
    * Contains the business logic (e.g., checking if a user is authorized to delete a post).
    * Talks to the UI and DAO layers.
3.  **DAO Layer (`com.blog.dao`)**
    * Data Access Object (DAO) layer.
    * The only layer that communicates with the database via Hibernate.
    * Performs all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
4.  **Entity Layer (`com.blog.entity`)**
    * POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects) that represent the database tables (`User`, `Post`, `Comment`).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

* **Core Language:** Java 8+
* **Database:** MySQL
* **ORM:** Hibernate 5.x
* **Build Tool:** Apache Maven

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You must have the following software installed:

* [Java (JDK) 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) or higher
* [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
* [MySQL Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)

### 1. Database Setup

1.  Open your MySQL client (like MySQL Workbench or the command line).
2.  Create a new database (schema) for the project.

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE blog_platform_db;
    ```

### 2. Configure Database Connection

1.  Navigate to `src/main/resources/`.
2.  Open the `hibernate.cfg.xml` file.
3.  Update the database connection properties with your MySQL username and password:

    ```xml
    <property name="hibernate.connection.url">jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/blog_platform_db</property>
    <property name="hibernate.connection.username">YOUR_MYSQL_USERNAME</property>
    <property name="hibernate.connection.password">YOUR_MYSQL_PASSWORD</property>
    ```

    Hibernate is configured with `hbm2ddl.auto = update`, so it will automatically create the `users`, `posts`, and `comments` tables the first time it runs.

### 3. Build and Run the Project

1.  Open a terminal and navigate to the project's root directory (where `pom.xml` is).
2.  Use Maven to build the project. This will download all dependencies.

    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

3.  Run the main application class from your terminal or directly from your Eclipse IDE.

    * **From Eclipse/IDE:** Right-click on `src/main/java/com/blog/App.java` -> **Run As** -> **Java Application**.
    * **From Maven (in terminal):**

        ```bash
        mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.blog.App"
        ```

You should now see the application menu running in your console!
